Philly Mesh members host and administrate several nodes within the Meshtastic network.

To run your own node with the `phillymesh.net-##`/`PM##` name, make sure that the number isn't already taken and check out [our repository for this website](https://github.com/phillymesh/phillymesh.net) for instructions on submitting an update to the site!

Redacted owner names are for privacy purposes and are optional, as is submitting location information for the map.
