Philly Mesh is a group for people who enjoy experimenting with mesh networking and related decentralized/distributed technologies.

**We are currently running several [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) nodes in the Greater Philadelphia area.**

Join the [**Philly Radio & Meshtastic Discord**](https://discord.gg/MWWbAkRR9v) to chat with others in the area. There is also a [**US - Philadelphia PA/Delaware Valley** room in the official Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.com/channels/867578229534359593/1280671409995255809).

If you are interested in learning more about Meshtastic and LoRa check out our [Getting Started guide](/2025/06/16/getting-started) which details local groups, Discords, and meetups, as well as best practices and lessons learned for using Meshtastic in our local area.

Not limited to 802.11-based networks (WiFi), Philly Mesh is open for experimentation with low-power wide-area networking such as LoRa or meshing via amateur radio projects such as AREDN. Other areas of interest include routing protocols and practices (such as BGP), overlay networks (such as Tor and Yggdrasil), and other networking-based projects/technologies (such as DNS, or even just networking fundamentals).
